# jens
### jens is a Rust templating _library_, not a templating _language_

The aim of Jens is to provide extremely lightweight templating, without
inventing a new language. This allows you to use the full power of Rust's
language features (such as pattern matching and enums) in your template
logic.

The main use case for this library is probably code generation, but it could
be used anywhere you need multi-line strings in your Rust code.
